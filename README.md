## Description

This is a sample [react](https://reactjs.org/) application using [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).

The user can type max. 10 characters in the input field which is copied to the squared are below as it is typed. If more than 10 characters are attempted to be typed then an error message is displayed
and the original input is kept.

There is a Clear button which clears both the input field and the squared area.
